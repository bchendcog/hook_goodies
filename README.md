# Scripts and Services for Hook (macOS)

This repository collects scripts and services written for the macOS productivity app, [Hook](https://hookproductivity.com/).

## Finder

This folder contains raw AppleScripts and System Service versions of two scripts:

**Hook To Clipboard**: Creates a hook link between the selected file and the link in your clipboard. The Service version of this can be triggered as a Finder Extra or via right click menu. The AppleScript version can be used in any kind of automation (Keyboard Maestro, BetterTouchTool, etc.)

**Mesh Hook**: Creates bi-directional links between two or more selected files. The AppleScript is written to work on a Finder selection, but could easily be modified to accept files from any automation that could pass them.
